The "H-Sanity" software allows to solve the above mentioned problem, through a web platform, where the client of the hotels in the city of Bogota will be able to visualize the sanitation guidelines that the hotel in which he/she wants to stay complies or not, in order to make an informed decision about it. 


# 3.End User:


The end user for this web platform will be the hotels in the city of Bogota and their clients.
